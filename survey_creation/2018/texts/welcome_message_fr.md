**The purpose of this survey is to collect information about people who develop software that is used in research. We also call these people *[Research Software Engineers](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers)* [(RSEs)](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers), but they use many different job titles (including postdoctoral researcher and research assistant).**

Why did I receive this invitation?
----------------------------------

You have received this link because you were identified as someone creating scientific software and because you are following one of the mailing list we used to disseminate the information.
There is currently little reliable information about the community of people creating research related software, so we have decided to collect this information to help funders and other research organisations develop policies.
This questionnaire gives you the opportunity to express your views about your current job and give us information about your career path.

Please note that this research is not compulsory and even if you decide to participate you can withdraw at any moment.

How long will it take?
----------------------

There are ca. 80 questions in this survey. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.
