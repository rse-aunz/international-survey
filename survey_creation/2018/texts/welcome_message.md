**The purpose of this survey is to collect information about people who develop software that is used in research. We also call these people *[Research Software Engineers](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers)* [(RSEs)](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers), but they use many different job titles (including postdoctoral researcher and research assistant).**


**Survey number: ERGO/FPSE/45232**

Why have I been asked to participate?
----------------------------------

You have received this link because you were identified as someone creating scientific software and because you are following one of the mailing list we used to disseminate the information.
There is currently little reliable information about the community of people creating research related software, so we have decided to collect this information to help funders and other research organisations develop policies.
This questionnaire gives you the opportunity to express your views about your current job and give us information about your career path.

Please note that this research is not compulsory and even if you decide to participate you can withdraw at any moment.

How long will it take?
----------------------

There are ca. 80 questions in this survey. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.

What will happen to me if I take part?
--------------------------------------

You will continue to the next page and answer several questions based on the country you are working from.


Are there any benefits in my taking part?
-----------------------------------------

We try to help Research Software Developer/Engineer to be recognised at an institutional level. There is no direct individual benefit to answer this survey.

Are there any risks involved?

Do I have to take part?
-----------------------

No, it is entirely up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you decide you do not want to take part, just close this page.
