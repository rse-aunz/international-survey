# README

This folder contains all the necessary files to analyse the data collected in the survey.
It comprises of python scripts to generate a clean dataset (and merging years togethers), as well as Jupyter notebooks to analyse and sharing the results.

# Folder structure
* [include](./include): Contains several python scripts used during the analysis (regardless of the year)
* [2016](./2016/): Folder containing the analysis for the 2016 survey. It contains the data from United Kingdom and Canada
* [2017](./2017/): Folder containing the analysis for the 2017 survey. It has separated folders for each countries that participate to the creation of the survey as well as two jupyter notebooks. One, being created automatically by the script [generate_2017_results.py](./generate_2017_results.py), and a second files that contains descriptions of the results.
* [2018](./2018/): folder containing the analysis for the 2018 survey
    * [data](./2018/data): Contains all the data about the 2018 survey and the merged results with the 2017 survey.

   * g. Publications and citations.ipynb: Questions regarding the citations of the RSE and their participation to conferences/workshops
   * h. Good practices, open source and tools.ipynb: Analysi of their practice in developing code and maintaining it, as well as which tools or OS the participants use.
   * i. Job satisfaction.ipynb: Self-reporting job satisfaction, turnover intention, perceived employability,...
   * j. Socio demography.ipynb: Questions about gender, ethnicity, age
   * k. Research Software Engineer.ipynb: Several questions specific to the Research Software Engineers organisation
   * x. All data.ipynb: All the sections above in one single file. It is here temporarily and going to be deleted when the 2018-survey branch is pushed into master

## Scripts in the current folder
* [cleaning.py](./cleaning.py): Script to run on the raw dataset to output a cleaned data set and an public one, in csv format. Only the main researcher can run that script as (s)he is the only one to have the raw data
* [generating_2017_results.py](./generating_2017_results.py): Script to generate the analysis notebooks for the 2017 survey. Kept for archive reason.
* [merging.years.py](./merging_years.py): Script to run after the 'cleaning.py'. It parse the 2017 cleaned and public data and merge them into the 2018 dataset (alongside doing some last minute cleaning).
